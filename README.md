This project is one of the first I put together as I develop my data analysis skills. 
A CSV file containing US insurance cost data was loaded in and put into various lists for analysis before putting all individuals data in a dictionary for easy access and further analysis.
After this, the plan is to use this same data and go further by doing some visualization and making models.
